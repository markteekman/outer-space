# Outer Space
A tech demo of an outer space world! This demo is made with CSS only, using features like Keyframes and Animations. The stars are created using a clever SCSS function. No JavaScript was used for this project. This project is build using my own [New Game](https://github.com/markteekman/new-game) Gulp Build (feel free to use it!).
